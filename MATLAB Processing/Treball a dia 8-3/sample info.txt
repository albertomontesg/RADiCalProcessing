Samples recorded from the Front-End team capturing a person walking from far and come near the antenna.
Each file is in different situations:

# sample1.mat : walking carrying two paper bins
# sample2.mat : walking without them (normal walking)
# sample3.mat : running to the antenna

At the end of the samples, the final waves are because the persona aproaching the antenna stops in front of it.

To load the variables write on MATLAB:
>> load('sample#.mat')
